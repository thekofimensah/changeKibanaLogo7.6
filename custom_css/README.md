# Update Kibana's Corporate Identity 

> This is a plugin that you can use in order to change the original Corporate Identity of Kibana to your own.

---

## Development

See the [kibana contributing guide](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions setting up your development environment. Once you have completed that, use the following yarn scripts.

  - `yarn kbn bootstrap`

    Install dependencies and crosslink Kibana and all projects/plugins.

    > ***IMPORTANT:*** Use this script instead of `yarn` to install dependencies when switching branches, and re-run it whenever your dependencies change.

  - `yarn start`

    Start kibana and have it include this plugin. You can pass any arguments that you would normally send to `bin/kibana`

      ```
      yarn start --elasticsearch.hosts http://localhost:9220
      ```
